Personal Maintain Program Development.    
PMP Personal Maintain Program ver. 0.0.8    
written by Kali_Yuga 2017 
poorly programmed. :D    
All Debian!    
Made for beginners that switched from Windows to Linux.    
Easy Update & Maintain your System on the Terminal.    
without having to know commands!    
this is basically just a Bash script for learning and it is not professional made!     
Mainly use it myself.    
No warranty whatsoever!    

to execute the script, change Permission's with sudo chmod +x & use with './PMP0.0.8' in Terminal.
